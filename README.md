# IntroToMLCoursework

Welcome to IntroToMLCoursework, a repository dedicated to providing clear explanations and implementations of various foundational machine learning algorithms I used in my time in CSE 151A @ UCSD. This project is designed for those new to machine learning, offering notebooks that cover key concepts and algorithms through examples and exercises.

## Overview

The content within this repository is structured around a series of Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a different machine learning algorithm or concept. These notebooks are part of an introductory course or personal study on machine learning, providing hands-on examples to help understand and apply these algorithms.

## Contents

- **01_Introduction_Questions.ipynb**: Introductory exercises and questions covering basic concepts in machine learning.
- **04_DecisionTrees.ipynb**: A deep dive into Decision Trees, including how to implement and apply them to real-world datasets.
- **05_ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks.ipynb**: Exploration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with examples demonstrating their use in image recognition tasks.
- **KMeansClustering.ipynb**: An overview of K-Means Clustering, showcasing its application in data segmentation and pattern recognition.
- **Lecture2_KNearestNeighbors.ipynb**: Introduction to the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, including its implementation and use cases.

## Getting Started

To get started with these notebooks, you will need to have Jupyter installed on your machine. You can install Jupyter via Anaconda or with pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

After installation, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IntroToMLCoursework.git
```

Navigate to the repository directory and start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
cd IntroToMLCoursework
jupyter notebook
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser, where you can open and run the notebooks.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the notebooks, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary Python libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, tensorflow, etc.)

Most libraries can be installed via pip:

Most libraries can be installed via pip:
